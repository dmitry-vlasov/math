Mathmatics source
=================
Sources for mathematics, based on [set.mm](https://github.com/metamath/set.mm "set.mm repository") 
from [Metamath language](https://metamath.org "Metamath language")
To create a head version of the base from set.mm do:
 1. run `metamath set.mm`
 2. in the metamath console type `save proof * /normal `
 3. `write uset.mm`
 4. `exit`
 
Caution: the size of the obtained source `uset.mm` file will exceed 150 mb.

 Several smaller fragments of the whole metamath base are included into the repository:
  * uset-10000   - the first 10 000 lines of uset.mm
  * uset-50000   - the first 50 000 lines of uset.mm
  * uset-100000   - the first 100 000 lines of uset.mm
